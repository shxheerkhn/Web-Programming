# EscrowIQ

EscrowIQ is a freelance marketplace prototype built around an escrow-first workflow: clients post jobs, freelancers send proposals, one proposal is accepted, funds are locked in escrow, work is submitted for review, and payment is either released, revised, disputed, or refunded.

The project combines a Flask backend, PostgreSQL persistence, server-rendered Jinja templates, session auth, SMTP email notifications, a Groq-powered chatbot assistant, and lightweight AI-style features for fraud analysis, ranking, and proposal drafting.

## Highlights

- Client and freelancer accounts with email verification
- Session-based authentication with CSRF protection
- Job posting with fraud scoring and validation
- Proposal lifecycle with accept/reject flows
- Escrow funding tied to the accepted freelancer and accepted bid amount
- Work submission with delivery note, link, zip upload, or folder upload
- Change requests, complaints, and admin complaint resolution
- In-app notifications plus branded email notifications
- Groq-powered chatbot assistant available across the site
- AI-style fraud analysis, matching, and proposal generation
- Cookie consent banner for a more realistic frontend experience

## Tech Stack

- Backend: Flask, SQLAlchemy Core, psycopg2
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Frontend: Jinja2 templates, vanilla JavaScript, custom CSS
- ML / scoring: scikit-learn TF-IDF similarity plus rule-based logic
- Chatbot: Groq API with `llama-3.1-8b-instant` by default
- Email: SMTP
- Password hashing: Werkzeug security helpers
- Testing: Python `unittest`

## Local Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- PostgreSQL
- SMTP credentials for email delivery
- Groq API key for the chatbot assistant

### Install Dependencies

From the project root:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you prefer the backend-specific list:

```powershell
pip install -r Backend/requirements.txt
```

## Environment Variables

This project currently reads local environment variables from `Backend/.env`.

Typical keys used by the app:

```env
SECRET_KEY=change-me
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://username:password@localhost:5432/escrowiq

SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USERNAME=your-email@example.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-app-password
SMTP_FROM_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
SMTP_USE_TLS=true

ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=change-me
FOUNDER_ALERT_EMAILS=founder@example.com

SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=false
AI_MODE=hybrid
AI_FALLBACK_ENABLED=true
GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key
GROQ_MODEL=llama-3.1-8b-instant
```

Notes:

- `GROQ_API_KEY` is required for the chatbot assistant to return live responses.
- `GROQ_MODEL` is optional; if omitted, the app defaults to `llama-3.1-8b-instant`.

## Running the App

The intended local entry point is:

```powershell
python Backend/run.py
```

What `Backend/run.py` does:

- loads `Backend/.env`
- initializes the schema if needed
- seeds demo users and jobs
- starts the Flask app
- makes the Groq-backed chatbot available if `GROQ_API_KEY` is configured

Default local URL:

```text
http://localhost:5000
```

Once the app is running, the chatbot can be opened from the floating `AI Help` button in the bottom-right corner of the UI.

## Demo / Seed Data

`Backend/run.py` seeds sample clients, freelancers, and jobs for a richer local demo.

There is also an optional AI-focused seed script:

```powershell
python Backend/seed_ai_test_data.py
```

That script creates:

- `ai_test_client@escrowiq.local`
- several freelancer profiles with matching-friendly skills
- jobs tailored to fraud scoring and recommendation scenarios

Default seeded password used there:

```text
demo123
```

## Running Tests

```powershell
python -m unittest tests.test_core_flows
```

Notes:

- tests are integration-style and expect PostgreSQL
- if `DATABASE_URL` is missing or not PostgreSQL, tests are skipped
- some test behavior depends on app config such as `TESTING=True`

## Deployment Notes

This repository includes:

- [vercel.json](</d:/FAST 6th Semester/Web Programming/Semester Project/Project Files/Web-Programming-main/Web-Programming-main/Project/vercel.json>)
- [VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md](</d:/FAST 6th Semester/Web Programming/Semester Project/Project Files/Web-Programming-main/Web-Programming-main/Project/VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md>)

Before deployment:

- set all required environment variables
- ensure PostgreSQL is reachable from the host
- confirm SMTP credentials are valid in production
- configure a valid `GROQ_API_KEY` if the chatbot should be enabled
- set `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true` behind HTTPS
- use a strong `SECRET_KEY`

## Current Realism / UX Notes

- The new cookie banner is a frontend realism feature and stores consent in `localStorage`
- Essential cookies are still used by the app for sessions and CSRF regardless of optional preference consent
- The project is still a prototype, not a production-hardened legal/privacy implementation

## Known Limitations

- No full migrations system such as Alembic
- Cookie consent is UI-only, not a full compliance framework
- SMTP and admin auth are environment-driven and fairly simple
- The chatbot depends on an external Groq API key and network access
- The app uses server-rendered templates rather than a component frontend
- Some docs in the repository are legacy notes and overlap with this README
